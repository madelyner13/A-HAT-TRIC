GENERAL TO DO LIST:
- integrate sabrina urdf to drone urdf in gazebo
- experiment with microros setup (it's all installed on host!!!)
	- link: https://www.hackster.io/514301/micro-ros-on-esp32-using-arduino-ide-1360ca
- write a simple node that takes in tag position and calculates how to move to get to it
- use /tag_detections/tagpose_body to determine if a tag has first been found
	- /tag_detections/tagpose_inertial always spits out non-zero values
	- this is done, but it needs to be tested
	- drone commands also need to be tested
	- collect a rosbag of:
		- /fmu/out/vehicle_local_position
		- /tag_detections/body_inertial
		- /fmu/in/trajectory_setpoint
	- set matlab up to open that rosbag (tag_detections is geometry_msgs, so should be fine)
- test compass that Ivan dropped off and connect transmitter
	- calibrate and test flight
- state machine reference, maybe useful??? https://github.com/robosoft-ai/SMACC2

THINGS FOR DOCUMENTATION:
- write instructions for setting up actual voxl2 environment
- need to add geometry_msgs to dependencies for offboard_control executable in CMakeLists.txt for px4_ros_com
- voxl-tag-detector.deb from joe 
- calibrate camera, update tag id/size in /etc/modalai/tag_locations.conf
