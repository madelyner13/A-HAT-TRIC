GENERAL TO DO LIST:
- investigate launch file for launching apriltag_localize_ws and voxl_mpa_to_ros2 together
- integrate sabrina urdf to drone urdf in gazebo
- experiment with microros setup (it's all installed on host!!!)
	- link: https://www.hackster.io/514301/micro-ros-on-esp32-using-arduino-ide-1360ca
- switch subscriber for tag position from /tag_detections/tagpose to /tag_detections/tagpose_body
- write a simple node that takes in tag position and calculates how to move to get to it
- record these trajectory setpoints to a rosbag
- play this rosbag back for the simulated drone and see what happens?
- or just make a 3d plot of the trajectory in matlab tbh, probably easier
- make sure the location of the apriltag in inertial coordinates is known, and so is the drone at the instance of offboard mode being engaged
- /tagpose_body does NOT natively report the frame_id as tagID - see if i can modify joe's code to fill this field
- figure out printing, since it's mad that %s is a char and not a str?

THINGS FOR DOCUMENTATION:
- write instructions for setting up actual voxl2 environment
- need to add geometry_msgs to dependencies for offboard_control executable in CMakeLists.txt for px4_ros_com
- voxl-tag-detector.deb from joe 
- calibrate camera, update tag id/size in /etc/modalai/tag_locations.conf
