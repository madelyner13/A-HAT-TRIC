- write a simple node that takes in tag position and calculates how to move to get to it
- can test it with a stationary tag in sim, probably?

THINGS FOR DOCUMENTATION:
- write instructions for setting up actual voxl2 environment
- need to add geometry_msgs to dependencies for offboard_control executable in CMakeLists.txt for px4_ros_com
